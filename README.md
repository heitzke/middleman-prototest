middleman-prototest
===================

The dream of middleman-prototest is to be a lightweight prototyping tool that can be deployed & iterated upon quickly. 

I'd recommend using Heroku as they make it really easy, and Middleman + Heroku play together very nicely.

Still a WIP, I haven't been able to spend much more time on the uglifier sass file to strip out ALL of the bootstrap polish.
